Final Project for MATH 480

For my final project I implemented a coordinate descent LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm in python. I used a soft thresholding method to find the optimal solution and k-folds cross-validation to select my parameters.  

I was able to utilize some of the SAGE graphing utilities to help model the testing errors and then preformed some brief analysis after running my algorithm on a set of baseball data.  

See project.sagews for the sage worksheet that outlines my code and results and Writeup.pdf for the analysis and overview.
