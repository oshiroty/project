Final Project for MATH 480

For my final project I plan on implementing a coordiante descent LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm in python.  

I plan on trying to utilize some of the SAGE graphing utilities to help model the testing errors and then preform some brief analysis after running my algorithm on a set of data.
